        <h2>About Pig and how to play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This game doesn't involve actual pigs. Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. This is a digitalized version of the original game. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)" target="_blank">Learn more about the Pig game and its origin.</a></li>
            <li>the game has 2 players, playing in rounds using a dice.</li>
            <li>In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their round score.</li>
            <li>BUT, if the player rolls a "1", all his ROUND score gets lost. After that it's the next player's turn. </li>
            <li>The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next players turn.</li>
            <li>The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.</li>
        </ul>
